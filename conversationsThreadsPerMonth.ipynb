This summer at the Digital Pedagogy Lab Institute, a group of us in Virginia worked during an afternoon to critique and explore new descriptors for the everyday digital realities that many people embrace, and that some people resist. There's another well-known dichotomy of \"resident\" and \"visitors,\" but that's also problematic... ultimately, we became rather flummoxed in finding a way to address what Henry is writing about here - youth are deploying their voices online, but what does that mean about their broader relationship to digital networks, data, and \"landscapes\"?\n",

It seems part of the point of movements to empower student voices or democratize web spaces to complicate our understanding of power dynamics and interrogate the ways that our own platforms (for example) subvert our intentions. I think our work will be stronger, not weaker, if we aggressively and generously show the ways that we fail, reinscribe problems, or struggle within broken parameters.

Such criticism basically reads like the same dystopian science fiction novel written over and over again: what seemed like a good idea at the time is now destroying us; the robots have risen up.\"\n",

However, many teachers are not prepared to take the step into critical analysis right away. So this becomes a question of strategy for achieving educational change. If we set the bar too high, requiring full purity of understanding, few educators will get involved. I've observed that when students investigate, plan, and take action, deeper critical consciousness can begin to evolve. Same with teachers. Must thought always come before experience, or can experience lead to reflection? I know these author/researchers have taught in real classrooms with real students, but do they remember how complex was the social situation they were in? Reality is messy - but it's what we need to deal with. I've seen too many radical teachers just become unicorns in their schools.\n",

Pushing just leads us back to the kind of authority that we're trying to help students critique.\n",

As one of my favorite teachers in this work, Elizabeth Robbins, has said, \"Young people are not the future - they are the NOW.\" (Check out her TEDx talk on YouTube.) Wonderful organizations like the Mikva Challenge are promoting this as well. Yes, they do support electoral participation, but they advance civic action for change in schools as well, in Chicago, LA, and DC. Why is only \"research\" discussed here? How about action that is happening right now in many schools and classrooms? I sense a gap here between academic research and real action happening out in schools.

I start my year by telling the students I'm not there to tell them everything, but rather to guide them in developing their own knowledge and skills. I explain there will be things I don't know, so we'll discover them together. Or I'll find an outside resource to help them understand. I invite them to disagree with me on ANY topic; they just need to provide evidence to support their point of view. The notion that teachers (or any other adults) are the holders-and-imparters-of-all-knowledge is SO 20th Century and needs to be abandoned. As for teachers being willing to embrace this shift I think is a combination of how supportive their administration is and how much of a growth mindset they (the teachers) have.\n",

For a long time under NCLB \"data driven\" was the final word--if it wasn't measured; it wasn't taught. Our students are whole people, with strengths going far beyond the classroom.

Though our personal process starts within our own schools, this is such a problem because it has taken over education as a whole. To get into college, they assess a students GPA and SAT/ACT scores which is generating college-aged students who don't know how to put together a proper sentence or who have no pathway to successful writing and remain lost. Then, they are sent into the working world. I think we need to address this problem both at the classroom level and outside of our own community. \n",

After attending an AVID conference in Philly this summer, I've been infusing poetry performances into many of my lessons.  Occasionally, I am inspired or moved by one I see on twitter and just open class by showing it - even when there is no topic or skill connection.   It's amazing how the students react.  They are usually captivated and have such emotional responses to them.  Looking back on the collection, most do highlight inequities and injustice.

As I have been pondering the unleashing of women's voices testifying to sexual, physical, and emotional abuse, I've been thinking about how we can read almost any text to uncover racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. Some of these are canonical texts like Shaw's *Pygmalion,* which I still teach because the text leans so critically against class and standard language, but also provides a great opportunity to read the ways in which women's lives are objects for men to act upon. On the other hand, I believe that we need to expand/explode the canon because too many voices are traditionally excluded. Portland State professor, Primus St. John, wrote an article about using the idea of \"dueling banjos\" — of hearing multiple voices about the same topic. Makes sense to me. \n",

            "dbrown18: I wonder what Lisa Delpit would think about Christensen's approach? I read an excerpt of Lisa Delpit's \"Skills and other Dilemmas of a Progressive Black Educator\" for a writing class I took. From what I remember, she adopted a philosophy that included both fluency and traditional writing skills because she believed only allowing African American students to succeed with process writing that embraces their vernacular was creating a greater equity gap. Here is a line I found on the web about the text: \" What Delpit suggests is a combination of fluency and skills in the classroom, because both are necessary to have any success in dominate culture's world. She writes \"if minority people are to effect the change which will allow them to truly progress we must insist on \"skills\" within the context of critical and creative thinking [fluency]\" (p. 19).\n",

If a student is on the lower end of the equity gap, then they are certainly disadvantaged compared to other students who already have the basic skills needed to further build upon.  The challenge for educators then, is to create a curriculum that both builds basic skills and facilitates the eagerness and cultural literacy of students. \n",

Here, argumentation is a characteristic of students' engaged learning - it's \"unleashed\" and is the antithesis of being \"hushed.\" My sense, although I stand to be corrected, is that many educators typically approach argumentation from a rather rationale stance - that, across disciplines, it's important for students to marshal evidence and develop a skill of arguing so as to prove a point. Here, however, the qualities of argumentation are quite different - not dictated by an educator and oriented toward a goal of more equitable classroom participation and social impact.\n",

There seems to be a hint here that strongly held ideological and political beliefs are in themselves suspect, since they lead to lack of good judgment about the accuracy of information in news and media. It might be wise, though, to consider underlying sources for those beliefs. Otherwise, we continue to be left with groups that are so deeply opposed to one another that they may never find common ground. I'm as passionate as most about which \"side\" I'm on, and in a way I'm surprised to hear myself saying this.

In so many cases the social action work is facilitated by a committed but singular teacher in a school, so when students go on to the next grade, they don't get to continue with this kind of learning. After-school clubs do ameliorate this somewhat, but those are too often sponsored by that committed teacher without extra compensation. HOWEVER, I've obsrved that a single year's experience can affect students long-term, because it's especially memorable. As the Polaris Academy students said in the video of their presentation at an Expeditionary Learning conference a few years ago, \"We thought we could change our city, but what we found is that we changed ourselves.\"\n",

For History Fair, he chose to develop a documentary on a student hunger strike that took place at Northwestern University in 1995.

In this article I point to work done by a group of first year students at DePaul University, as part of a \"coming to Chicago class\". They used my maps and web site as resource material, then divided the city into five sectors. Each group adopted one sector and over their 7-10 week class they spent time learning about the differences in each sector, and the availability of non-school tutor/mentor programs. Each week they posted a blog article showing their findings. If you note the articles at the end of year 2  there were suggestions for the next group.\n",

            "paulallison: Sometimes this takes weeks or even months. I remember taking a walk with an art teacher several years ago, and I asked him how a particular student was doing in his class, and specifically *what* he was working on because it was hard for me to figure out how to get him connected to my work in English. It was November, just before Thanksgiving, and my colleague said, \"I haven't figured out what his project will be yet,\" he said, before going on to explain a couple of things he had tried without success. I was struck with how patient he was being in letting the project come to the student, and not forcing him into a prescribed curriculum. Waiting is so hard, yet the work produced once there is a \"flow\" for a student makes it worth the wait. This has strong implications for school structures however! We need to be with students for longer periods of time. It also has implications for how groups work together. Perhaps a student who hasn't found his/her project yet can help others?\n",

What challenges, what happy moments, what is he/she curious about? Sometimes the excitement of other students is contagious, sometimes not. Last week I sat with a 7th grader whom teachers regard as a problem kid. He was bored with the novel the class is reading. We started poking around the internet together. Said he was interested in airplanes. Do you know what makes them fly? I asked. We looked on the web. Thanks to my physics background, I could see that many of the explanations are surprisingly WRONG! I explained the bernoulli effect. He asked more and more questions. Curiosity that school didn't seem to connect with.

I am always surprised at what works and what doesn't  and how the trifling-est practice sometimes works. I understand, too, that the reason we propose 'best practice' and do research to determine what is best practice is to pare down on the universe of options available to us as teachers and learners.  As an experiment ask a student what they might consider best practice for learning a particular thing and I think you might be surprised.

It is also important in light of their argument to point out the inequities we see replicated generation after generation in literacy instruction that make the phrase seem tone deaf. If we know what best practices are, why do we continually underserve those in the margins? \n",

In complex settings, Snowden claims, we can only probe and respond to make meaning of what will work.
